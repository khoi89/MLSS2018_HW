    "For an RL agent, it often starts off naive in a brand new enviornment that it knows nothing about, other than the fact that the environment can provide it with feedback in the form of reward/punishment. It is often the case that exploration is necessary for an RL agent to source enough information about its available actions given a state and the potential state transitions that come about given an action. This allows the RL agent to learn a policy and optimize its value function. However, the purpose of an RL agent is to maximize its reward and at some point in its existence in the environment, it must exploit and take advantage of what it already knows. Exploitation could be good for the RL agent for it to capitalize on a given set of knowledge that it has gained from exploration. However, in non-static environments, exploration is necessary for the RL agent to not get stuck with a suboptimal policy. As an example, in the e-greedy implemention, it's always good to have a small random chance to influence the RL agent to explore, which could allow it to update its values accordingly in a non-static environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely put - an animal can forage around in the forest for food. It lands in a patch that is rich with food and exploits this area. However, given the non-static nature of its environment (e.g., seasons, migration), the animal staying at the same patch is not optimal and it must explore to find different patches of food as the environment changes. It seems like biologically speaking, all biological agents have that innate explore/exploit tradeoff as it's crucial to survival. It's quite cool to see this aspect of life be integrated into an RL agent, as well."

    "2\\. Another fundamental reinforcement learning challenge is what is known as the *credit assignment problem*, especially when rewards are sparse. \n",
    "What do we mean by the phrase, and why does this make learning especially difficult?\n",
    "How does this interact with reward function design, where we have to be careful that our reward captures the true objective?"

    "It's not always the case that every action given a state leads to an actionable outcome, aka. feedback from the environment. RL updating is all about back-propagation and in the case of the lake example we had today, a given RL agent will only receive feedback once it goes from the start to finish. Here, the first time the RL agent finishes, the penultimate state-action pair are updated and nothing more. This credit is then transferred back and back as the RL agent revisits the state in the future. Some of this credit assigment problem can be aleviated if we consider model-based RL, rather than model-free RL that we went over today."

In Q-learning, we assume the agent will take the best possible action: $\\max_a Q_\\pi(s_{t+1}, a)$. SARSA, on the other hand, uses the action that was actually taken next in the episode we are learning from: $Q_\\pi(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$. In other words, SARSA learns from the next action he actually took (on policy), as opposed to what the max possible Q value for the next state was (off policy).\n",
